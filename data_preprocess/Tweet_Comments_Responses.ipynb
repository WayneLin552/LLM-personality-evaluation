However, @ModernInvest raised a valid point of caution with a recent post & that has motivated me to write about it off the cuff.\\n\\nIn a potential epoch where Bitcoin becomes the bedrock of our banking system, its finite supply will cast a long shadow over the practice of fractional reserves. Unlike the fraudulent nature of fiat currency, Bitcoin‚Äôs hard cap at 21 million coins is an unyielding constant.\\n\\nBitcoin‚Äôs architecture enshrines a deflationary ethos, a currency limited by unalterable code rather than the whims of monetary or political policy. Something the public is ever more vocally becoming aware of. Banks that adopt Bitcoin will therefore be forced to reconcile their balance sheets with digital scarcity.\\n\\nWhere traditional banks dance a delicate ballet (with two broken feet) of lending ALL of what they hold, a Bitcoin bank must contend with a ledger of public truth. Overreach here is not a ledger entry easily obscured but a clear departure from Bitcoin‚Äôs covenant of scarcity.\\n\\nShould banks issue IOUs against a fractional reserve of Bitcoin, they would inadvertently fuel a rally on withdrawal demands. The act of acquiring Bitcoin in the open market to satisfy these claims would thrust the price upwards‚Äî a simple edict of supply & demand. Should the powers that be hypothetically attempt to prevent to purchase and sale of Bitcoin, it would incentivize a competing power to facilitate that very function. Thus swiftly eliminating competition. \\n\\nWithin crypto markets, \"the streets is always watching\" with a hawk‚Äôs eye, poised to punish over-leverage without remorse. Banks that gamble with reserves will find no lender of last resort in a decentralized realm; the market‚Äôs culling is both judge and executioner.\\n\\nWithout central banks to print a safety net, over-leveraged institutions on a Bitcoin standard will invariably meet their Icarian fate. Insolvency is not a systemic risk but an individual reckoning, ensuring a hard-forged path to fiscal responsibility.\\n\\nThe market‚Äôs invisible hand casts a long shadow over imprudent banking. The finite nature of Bitcoin creates a direct incentive to favor sound financial practices. It‚Äôs a world where only the fittest will survive.\\n\\nThus, Bitcoin‚Äôs essence could reshape banking into a bastion of trust and value. Banks holding Bitcoin must embrace its discipline, or face a reckoning.', 'Come , and Join with me... üí£\\n\\nFirst 1000 users will be considered for potential Airdrop , Be fast $DEX  is coming on Solana üí•\\n\\nüí•First 500 users who Retweet and Drop their #SOL address will get AirdropüéÅ\\n#FCFS #Solana #Bitcoin', 'bitcoin has a chain?', '#Bitcoin offers corporations an innovative strategy to preserve their capital and create shareholder value by leveraging their balance sheets with $BTC, providing an escape from the destructive cycle of expensive acquisitions, buybacks, dividends, & debt.', 'Interview with David Lin on #bitcoin #AI #transformativetechnologies piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=iCH9R4ws‚Ä¶', 'Took it too literal ü§£', 'Hi everyone, I just minted another Bitcoin Girl.

Remember! Inflation does not necessarily = sell pressure. Sell pressure is determined by a variety of factors such as market confidence, sentiment, large inflation spikes, rogue whales, and market cycles.\\n\\nInflation is a temporary challenge to deal with on the road to mass adoption and acceptance of $HEX as a store of value. To help you understand why sell pressure won't keep HEX or Pulse prices down forever, we have to look at the data.\\n\\n#PulseChain inflation over the past month sits at around 14.32 Billion $PLS or about $900,000. \\nOn a 2x that's $1.8 Million of inflation per month.\\nOn a 4x that's $3.6 Million of inflation per month.\\nOn a 10x that's $18 Million of inflation per month.\\nOn a 100x that's $180 Million of inflation per month.\\n\\nBetween October of 2021 and October of 2022, $HEX on #Ethereum did over $6 Billion of volume. That amount of volume is 33x as much as one month of #PulseChain inflation after a 100x price increase from today. So in this way, PulseChain does have significant headroom before hitting triple digit dollar inflation levels (in millions).\\n\\nNow let's look at HEX's Inflation last month:\\n‚¨£ HEX on #PulseChain: $11.8 Million of inflation last month.\\n‚¨£ HEX on #Ethereum: $3.56 Million of inflation last month.\\n‚¨£ HEX Combined: $15.36 Million of inflation last month. The average USD inflation for #HEX since Jan 2021 is ~$45M per month.\\n\\nThe combined $HEX inflation per month at current prices is 60% below the average monthly dollar inflation since 01-01-2021. For the combined $HEX price to reach $180 million of inflation per month, it would need to see a 120x price increase (see Combined HEX Price Chart below).\\n\\nThere are other variables to account for.\\n\\nIn HEX, inflation is always exported out into the future making it less effective in the present. This pushes potential sell pressure farther and farther out into the future.\\nIn PulseChain, the inflation changes based on the amount of transactions on the chain. This means that as more and more adoption comes to Pulse, the less #PLS inflation can hit the market.\\n\\nIn both cases, adoption drives prices drastically higher and reduces inflation and potential sell pressure in the present. If $BTC can deal with billions of dollars a month in sell pressure from miners, $15 million dollars of newly minted sell pressure won't stop HEX from rising to the top. \\n\\nSame goes for Pulse.\\n \\nSee @saylor talking about #BTC sell pressure three minutes into this interview.\\nhttps://https://twitter.com/CryptoOcean_/status/1720745766225060245\\n\\nFor More information on $HEX Annualized Inflation Charts message @hexfireio or visit HEXFIRE.IO\\n\\nFor More information on #PulseChain inflation or other metrics visit pulsecoinlist.com/stats or GoPulse.com.\\n\\nFor the full HEX chart visit: hexchart.com\\n\\nNo force on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\", 'You: ‚ÄúI sold my #Bitcoin‚Äù\\n\\nMe:', 'I have to be a verified twitter account to run ads.

I really think our guys are getting acclimated to the Vic Fangio defense.\\n\\n- David Long is also establishing himself as a top tier linebacker.\\n\\nüê¨ Dolphins O \\n\\n- The Chiefs run D has been below average. \\n\\n- This will also be amplified tomorrow without Nick Bolton\\n\\n- We obviously know that the Dolphins have been one of the best rushing teams.\\n\\n- And tomorrow, Terron Armstead and Connor Williams comes back. Two of the best run blockers in the NFL.\\n\\n- I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôll stop our passing attack too.\\n\\n- You can try and mimic what the Patriots did by having many guys at the back but they don‚Äôt have the guys to then stop the run.\\n\\n- Yes they have Chris Jones.

The more I began to read and understand the region (including visiting and interviewing people on both sides), however, the more clear it become that:\\n\\n1) Jews have an historic claim to the land (at least 1,500 years before Muslims). Jews are the traditional landowners, so to speak, and while they‚Äôve been conquered and displaced by a dozen different empires over the past 2,500 years, when the Ottoman Empire fell after WWI and the Brits and French began carving out new countries, one was promised to the Jews living in the region. (Arab Muslims were given control in Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and eventually took over in Lebanon).\\n\\n2) Israel clearly wants peace, and has made concessions, given away land, and has agreed to peace deals half a dozen times, each time flat-out rejected by the Arabs. \\n\\n3) Yes, ethnic cleansing took place: when ~1M Jews were forced out of every Muslim country in the Middle East over the past 100 years, nearly all of whom were resettled in Israel. Wealthy Arab states DO NOT accept or resettle Arab Palestinian refugees. Why is that? Why don\\'t they receive international pressure to do so?\\n\\n4) Yes, there is Apartheid: Jews cannot safely enter neighbouring Arab countries, including and especially the Palestinian territories. There are ZERO Jews living in Gaza. Arab Israelis, by contrast, make up 20% of the population of Israel and seem well-integrated, successful and happy (on avg). Arab Palestinians were given visas and work permits to enter Israel, a program that was sadly manipulated by Hamas and used to help plan the October 7th massacre.\\n\\n5) The fundamental problems in Gaza clearly stem from lack of responsible governance, namely, no rule of law, no accountability, no economic foundations, a leadership class that prioritizes terrorism over basic infrastructure and steals from its people so much so that the leaders of Hamas are literal BILLIONAIRES while most Palestinians don\\'t have access to clean water.\\n\\nKnowing and understanding all of this after \"actually studying the past\" helps us draw the following conclusions about this conflict:\\n\\n1) October 7th happened DURING A CEASEFIRE. So why on earth would Israel agree to going back to another one? Calling for another ceasefire is de facto siding with Hamas in saying that they can exist and go on just as they did before Oct 7th. Israel can never and should never agree to that.\\n\\n2) Calling for a ceasefire is NOT calling for peace, because there can never be peace with Hamas in charge (just ask Hamas, who reminds us daily that they will never accept a Jewish state and will never stop waging war against Jews). If you want peace, call for Hamas to unconditionally surrender, return all hostages and turn over its leaders to be tried for war crimes.\\n\\nIt\\'s easier to blame the Jews for all the misery in Gaza, but a sober analysis shows that Palestinian leadership has utterly failed its people, that Islamist antisemitism -- not land disputes -- is the driving geopolitical force behind this conflict, that Israel must defend itself, and that woke academics are seriously radical and SHOULD NOT be in charge of shaping the minds of the next generation.', 'Republican Congressman Says He Won‚Äôt Run for Reelection in Light of Party‚Äôs Election Conspiracy Theories - People apple.news/AeUW2ibd-RiK-2kX1‚Ä¶', 'A bullet from an assault weapon can travel nearly triple the speed of sound.

It‚Äôs not merely about setting stop-losses; it‚Äôs also about understanding the ‚Äònutrition‚Äô and ‚Äòrest‚Äô your portfolio needs. A well-balanced ‚Äòdiet‚Äô of risk and drawdown management strategies and a ‚Äòrestful‚Äô approach to not overtrade are crucial.  \\n\\n2. Market Situational Awareness (Safety Needs): Building on the base, a trader needs to establish a ‚Äòsafe home‚Äô in the market. This means recognizing when the market ‚Äòweather‚Äô is stormy and when it‚Äôs calm, much like we seek shelter in adverse conditions and venture out when it‚Äôs safe. This level is about finding security in the midst of market chaos. It‚Äôs about understanding when the hunting is productive and when it‚Äôs fruitless.   \\n\\n3. Strategy Execution (Love/Belonging Needs): Just as we seek connection with others, traders need to ‚Äòconnect‚Äô with their strategies on a deeper level, almost like a partnership. This isn‚Äôt a superficial connection but rather a profound understanding and ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô with the strategy, knowing when it works, when it doesn‚Äôt, and feeling a sense of ‚Äòbelonging‚Äô in the market ecosystem.  \\n\\n4. Analysis (Esteem Needs): Here, the trader‚Äôs ‚Äòself-esteem‚Äô comes from within, driven by the internal validation of seeing strategies succeed and the ability to pinpoint and learn from failures. Recognition might also come from the outside in the form of respect from fellow traders, but the core is self-respect through self-improvement and achieved results.  \\n\\n5. Mastery: In this highest state, just as humans seek to fulfill their potential, traders seek to fulfill their ‚Äòtrading potential.‚Äô They can intuitively sense shifts in market momentum, are in tune with their emotional and psychological state, and can express themselves through their unique trading style. It‚Äôs the trading equivalent of finding one‚Äôs ‚Äòcalling‚Äô and expressing one‚Äôs innermost capabilities.\", 'My character may be a pretty birb, but she tends to belittle the human race on occasion and only shows her approval of their existence for providing quality entertainment and food.', \"Janitor at New Jersey elementary school is arrested after 'lacing canteen food with bleach, urine and FECES - and posting lewd acts with inanimate objects on social media while working' - as children have reported diarrhea and vomiting | Daily Mail Online dailymail.co.uk/news/article‚Ä¶\", '@SNUAthletics getting it done today! \\n@SNUSoccerW go 3-1 over SWOSU! \\n@SNUSoccerM go 4-1 over Newman!\\nMen‚Äôs @snu_rugby 22-12 over KU! \\n@SNUFootball 41-14 over Monticello!\\n@SNUSoftball serving at the Regional Food Bank!

And you think you can undo all that in 2 weeks?  \\n\\nPlease.  Don\\'t fall for bullshit marketing claims.\\n\\n2) Nuts, seeds and granola is health food.  \\n\\nIt\\'s bird food. High in calories, easy to overeat and not filling.  Do not snack on this stuff thinking you are helping yourself.  Avoid.  \\n\\nReplace it with high protein options - greek yoghurt and fruit for example.\\n\\n3) Eating breakfast is the most important meal of the day.\\n\\nThere is nothing magical about breakfast. It helps some people. It doesn\\'t help others.  If you are going to eat it, make it protein based.  Eat it or don\\'t.  \\n\\nNo one meal is more important than any other.\\n\\n4) You can\\'t eat after 6pm if you want to lose fat.\\n\\nAnother bullshit claim.  \\n\\nEat when you want but pay attention to how it makes you feel and how it impacts your energy levels.  There is no one size fits all approach.\\n\\n5) Doing cardio is the best thing for fat loss.  \\n\\nWrong. You want to focus on strength training for fat loss for a number of reasons...\\n\\n1. It ensures the maximum amount of weight-loss comes from body fat. Not muscle.  \\n\\n2. It\\'s better at increasing your metabolism.  \\n\\n3. It builds a lean, proportioned body. A v-shaped back is not built on a treadmill.\\n\\nThis is not to say cardio is a waste of time. You need it for a healthy heart and it\\'s great for mental/emotional regulation\\n\\nStrength train 2-3 x a week and hit cardio a few times a week for optimal results\\n\\n6) Believing you have to workout 6-7 times a week.\\n\\nWrong. You are self sabotaging yourself before you already begin by setting unrealistic expectations.  You can achieve fantastic results by training just 3 times a week and building a sustainable plan around your life.\\n\\nIf you workout 3 days a week, eat ample protein and aim to walk as much as possible, you are 80% there.  This is achievable for everyone.  \\n\\nStop overcomplicating it.\\n\\n7) High rep training burns more fat  \\n\\nDoing harder exercises with more resistance that really challenge your body is a far more effective strategy.\\n\\nWhen trying to lose fat you want to train for muscle and strength gain not just doing endless reps for the sake of it.\\n\\nLight weights and higher reps might give you that burning sensation and a pump, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs giving you the results you‚Äôre seeking.  \\n\\nGenerally speaking, work between the 6-15 rep range and focus on feeling your muscles work\\n\\n8) You can spot reduce fat with isolation exercises.\\n\\nPeople are still doing 1000 crunches per day hoping to trim down their waist. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.  You get your body fat low enough to see your abs from proper training and diet not by doing endless stomach exercises.\\n\\n9) Eggs are bad for you.\\n\\nIf you aren\\'t eating eggs for fear of raising your cholesterol, you\\'ve been duped.  \\n\\nEggs =  \\n\\n- Full of protein and healthy fats \\n- Help lower \"bad\" cholesterol \\n- One of the most filling foods \\n- Contain essential vitamins \\n- Versatile  \\n\\nEat your damn eggs\\n\\n10) Carbs are the enemy of fat loss.\\n\\nYou can eat carbs and still lose fat. Most of my clients do.  The key is to not eat processed shit and focus on rice, sourdough bread, potatoes etc  Pair them with high protein foods and don\\'t overeat them.  \\n\\nSimple.\\n\\nAnything you would add?

The primary drawback is the lack of true asset ownership. \\nIn most cases, players are unable to trade, sell, or liquidate their in-game assets. \\nThis lack of ownership limits their ability to derive tangible value from their gaming experiences.\\n\\nNow, let's compare that to the evolving landscape of Web3, where 'Play to Own' is taking center stage. \\nWith the introduction of blockchain technology, players gain genuine ownership of their digital assets. \\nThis means that every item, NFT, or cryptocurrency acquired in a game holds real-world value and can be traded in secondary markets.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for gamers? \\n\\nIt's a paradigm shift in which they are in control of their assets, free from the risk of losing them due to centralized database management. \\nThey can prove and verify the origin of their digital items, enhancing trust and reducing the chances of fraud. \\nIt's not just gaming; it's about true ownership and value creation.\\n\\nDexioprotocol is at the forefront of this revolution, bringing 'Play to Own' to the gaming community. \\nWe believe that this model offers a superior value proposition for both players and game operators. \\nPlayers enjoy security, trust, and long-term value, while operators benefit from happier and more loyal customers.\\n\\nIt's about breaking free from the constraints of Web2 gaming and embracing the empowerment of Web3. \\n\\nJoin @dexioprotocol  on this exciting journey of gaming reinvented. \\n\\n‚è¨   \\n\\nNew Website     \\ndexioprotocol.com \\n\\nWhitepaper \\ndexioprotocol.gitbook.io \\n\\nTelegram     \\nt.me/dexiochat\\n\\n‚è´\\n\\n#gaming #Web3 #PlayToOwn #Dexioprotocol #AugmentedReality\", 'There you go #14 Raleek ‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæ#fighton #BeatTheHuskies', 'Cancellation denied', 'Citizens all over the world stand with you.

Carbon dating revealed the drawings dated back approximately 12,600 years, offering a unique window into the late Pleistocene era in South America.\\n\\nThe etchings depicted various fauna prominent during the last ice age, such as giant ground sloths and mastodons. This provided evidence that the environment was much different than the modern Amazon rainforest, dominated by now-extinct megafauna. The natural pigments used - hematite and manganese - indicated an early artistic tradition among the indigenous populations.\\n\\nThrough analyzing recurring motifs and imagery, scientists gained new cultural insights. Hunting scenes and ceremonial depictions suggested spiritual rituals and social organization within the Pleistocene communities. Over time, the art cave became an important site for researchers seeking to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions and hunter-gatherer lifeways during the late Quaternary period.', 'hope you reach it vero!! \\U0001faf6üèª\\U0001faf6üèª', 'With art, we bridge the gap‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è', \"#BravermanOut is trending\\n \\nI'd say the whole fucking lot of them have to go.

Eisenhower inspected art treasures stolen by the Germans, which had been hidden in a salt mine in Germany. Standing alongside him in the photo are Omar Bradley to his left and George Patton behind him.\\n\\nDuring Hitler's rule, he established a group dedicated to looting cultural and artistic treasures in Nazi-occupied countries. As a passionate art connoisseur (despite being a failed artist himself), Hitler demanded that all looted art be placed under his personal control. The stolen art, consisting of more than a million pieces scattered across Europe, with around 100,000 still unaccounted for, was concealed in various locations, including castles and salt mines throughout Austria and Germany.\\n\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt initiated the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFAA) with the objective of safeguarding cultural treasures from the ravages of war and returning stolen artworks to their rightful owners. The Monuments Men, a group composed of 345 individuals from 13 countries, was tasked with protecting cultural property from wartime destruction and preserving works of art and other cultural artifacts seized by the Nazis.\\n\\nThese individuals scoured European countries for looted art and artifacts during and after the war, an endeavor that even inspired a Hollywood movie. General Eisenhower issued orders for his forces to support the MFAA without impeding their military duties and to make every effort to safeguard important monuments from harm.\\n\\nFollowing the war, the MFAA uncovered 1,500 hidden repositories of looted artifacts in Germany, as well as items that had been legitimately concealed for safekeeping. However, to this day, over 1,000 pieces remain missing. In recent years, galleries, dealers, and museums have been conducting extensive research into paintings that changed hands in Europe between 1933 and 1945, identifying gaps in their provenance or chain of ownership. Thanks to the internet, suspected Nazi-looted art is increasingly being posted on various websites.\", 'Congrats to @GanderBaseball U15 Pilots and Rob Kelly for winning @BaseballNL Grassroots Team and Coach of the Year.

It is a development framework for building blockchains, designed to provide maximum freedom and minimal effort. It allows developers to focus on their application logic by providing plug-and-play functionality for networking, consensus, and storage. It also supports upgrades without a hard fork, and allows developers to write blockchain logic in any language that can compile to WebAssembly (Rust, C/C++, C#, Go, etc).\\n\\n- Substrate is open-source, meaning it is not copyright protected in the traditional sense. Open-source software allows anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the project's source code. This is a common practice in the software industry to encourage collaboration and transparency.\\n\\n- Even if other projects outside of Polkadot use Substrate, it still benefits Polkadot in several ways: \\n\\n1. **Ecosystem Growth**: When more projects use Substrate, it leads to a larger and more diverse ecosystem. This can result in more developers contributing to the Substrate codebase, leading to faster innovation and improvement of the technology. \\n\\n2. **Interoperability**: Substrate-built blockchains are natively compatible with Polkadot. Even if a project initially operates outside of Polkadot, the use of Substrate makes it easier for that project to connect to Polkadot in the future if they choose to do so. This potential for increased interoperability can strengthen Polkadot's network effects. \\n\\n3. **Reputation and Adoption**: The widespread use of Substrate can enhance the reputation of Polkadot, as it demonstrates the utility and flexibility of the technology that underpins Polkadot. This can lead to increased adoption of Polkadot itself. \\n\\n4. **Shared Security**: If these projects decide to connect to Polkadot as a parachain, they can tap into Polkadot's pooled security. This means that these projects contribute to and benefit from the collective security of the entire Polkadot network.\\n\\n- While it's true that other chains using Substrate can grow and potentially make profits, this doesn't necessarily mean that Polkadot is left behind. The growth of these chains can contribute to the overall strength and value of the Polkadot network. Furthermore, Polkadot's design allows for arbitrary message passing, which can enable any application to thrive in the Web3 ecosystem.\", 'The global Web 3.0 blockchain market was USD\\xa01.73 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a CAGR of 47.1% from 2023 to 2030, driven by the growing demand for data privacy, the rise of digital assets, and advancements in 5G and 6G technologies.\\ngrandviewresearch.com/indust‚Ä¶', 'I have voted by mail for 20 plus years and there isn‚Äôt ANYTHING wrong with it!

By employing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), scientists have been able to remove the dense rainforest cover and uncover the remnants of an ancient Mayan city, which is nearly twice the size of the City of Vancouver.\\n\\nLIDAR, short for \"Light Detection and Ranging,\" is a technology that allows researchers to examine the Earth\\'s surface. This technology employs pulsed laser beams to measure variable distances, generating precise three-dimensional data about the Earth\\'s shape and surface characteristics. By combining these laser pulses with other recorded information collected by airborne systems, LIDAR offers valuable insights into the examined area\\'s topography.\\n\\nThe capabilities of LIDAR are remarkable. Kathryn Reese-Taylor, a professor at the University of Calgary, states, \"You can be trying to survey and map sites in the rainforest, and what would take you years to accomplish, LIDAR can do in a couple of days of flying over these large areas.\"\\n\\nThe University of Calgary reports that an international team of researchers conducted a comprehensive LIDAR survey spanning over 36 square miles of forest canopy in southeastern Mexico, specifically in the Calakmul region. Calakmul served as a Mayan capital between approximately A.D. 635 and 850.\\n\\nThe survey findings unveiled an expansive urban settlement featuring extensive residential compounds concentrated around temples, shrines, and potentially marketplaces. The inhabitants of Calakmul relied on an advanced agricultural system supported by canals, terraces, walls, and dams.

On the monophonic side, \"Mono/Poly\" emerged with 4VCO, exceeding the expected specs. Both models were not just instruments; they were masterpieces equipped with arpeggiators and chord memory. \"Polysix\" boasted 32 editable memories and offered a spectrum of effects like chorus, phase, and ensemble. All this could be easily stored and recalled. As the name suggested, \"Mono/Poly\" could create 4-voice polyphonic sounds, and its effect section included synchronization and cross modulation to generate an array of unique sounds!', 'Isn‚Äôt happy hour any time? ü•É\\n\\n#JohnnyDepp üé¨\\n#ThrowbackThursday üóìÔ∏è', '#ThrowbackThursday of a Black Dynamite piece from Inktober a few years ago. #blackdynamite #inktober #art #sketch #illustration', 'From broker calls to clicks, paper certs to digital assets, and strict hours to 24/7 trading‚ÄîSwissCheese transformed stock trading! \\nGone are the days of market mysteries and fee frenzies. \\nTrade smart, trade anytime: SwissCheese.finance/\\n#ThrowbackThursday #SwissCheeseEvolution', 'Throwback to the #MOTOE premiere on this day 6 years ago.
