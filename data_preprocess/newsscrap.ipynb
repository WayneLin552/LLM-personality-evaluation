              "array([['25 Years Later: Beck Turns To Dense Acoustics & Airy Melodies on ‘Mutations’',\n",
              "        'By the time Beck arrived at his sixth studio album, he was an established unstoppable force. After the creative leaps he took from one project to the next and coming off of the massive success of the hip-hop-influenced Odelay, the artist saw his next album as a blank canvas. Beck is a chameleon of an artist, fearlessly diving headfirst into a plethora of styles and sonics throughout his career, and his sixth album might be his most ambitious. And while Mutations fell short of the commercial success of Odelay, it cemented Beck as a pure artist. By ignoring the praise of his previous release, Beck was able to reinvent himself once again with a stunning set of songs that take more from psychedelic rock and ambient folk than anything else. Beck tapped famed Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich for Mutations (released 11/3/98), and his impact was clear from the start. Beck began working on the album in the spring of 1998 and was originally not supposed to be released by Geffen, the major label behind Beck. The artist negotiated for the LP to be released by independent label Bong Load Records, but once Geffen heard the expansive and undeniable LP, they voided the contract and released the album themselves. This led to a lawsuit from Beck against Geffen and one from Geffen against Beck, starting a vicious legal battle between the two. Boiled in controversy and lined with majestic arrangements and poetic songwriting, Mutations was a statement piece for Beck both creatively and business-wise. The sonic direction Beck took on his sixth LP was nothing short of shocking and mesmerizing. The sampling techniques executed on Odelay were almost completely pushed to the side to make room for dense acoustics and airy melodies. Beck dove headfirst into a more singer/songwriter style for Mutations, penning intimate lyrics and setting them to sparse rock psychedelic. He sets the tone for the album with the opener “Cold Brains”, a rollercoaster of an instrumental that gives the track a wavy sensation while Beck’s soaring vocals give the track the steadiness it needs. You can hear the folk influences on moments like “Lazy Flies” and “Dead Melodies”, but even in these moments of intimacy, Beck finds a way to add the perfect amount of texture and layered vocals to make these acoustics feel explosive. That is the sonic tightrope Beck traversed for Mutations, creating folksy rock with personal and brutally honest lyrics with an otherworldly twist on the arrangements. Mutations would not sell as well as Odelay, but the praise Beck’s sixth album received showed otherwise. The album would go on to win a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album and garner immense praise from critics across the board. Everything from the music to its rollout felt risky but 25 years later, Mutations cemented Beck as a limitless artist whose fearless approach to music can birth gorgeous moments regardless of which genre he decides to attack.'],\n",

              "        'DEVO has achieved one of the most coveted prizes in all of music, longevity. After 50 years of crafting mind-altering LPs, the band has been celebrating in more ways than one. Along with compiling some of their best tracks for a career-defining anthology, DEVO has been touring the world on their “50 Years of De-Evolution” farewell tour. Last night (November 2), the band finally brought their show to the States as DEVO took over Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium for their first stop in the U.S. DEVO pieced together a setlist that explored every corner of their storied career while continuing to surprise fans with special treats throughout the night. DEVO’s show started off exactly how you would imagine, with a stirring rendition of “Don’t Shoot (I’m A Man)” from Something for Everybody LP. That was the only song performed from that album but luckily, the band spent their time with some classics. The band performed plenty of tracks from their 1980 Freedom of Choice LP, pulling out tracks like “Gates of Steel”, “Girl U Want”, and the forever classic “Whip It”. DEVO also focused heavily on their classic debut album with songs like “Mongoloid” and “Uncontrollable Urge” making an appearance. They also switched things up with covers of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones and “Secret Agent Man” by P.F. Sloan. They wrapped up the night with a three-song encore that included “Freedom of Choice”, “Gut Feeling (Slap Your Mammy)” and “Beautiful World”. DEVO is just getting started here in the States. The band will tour primarily on the West Coast with stops in Portland, San Francisco, and Huntington Beach. Check out the full list of dates, setlist, and footage from last night’s performance below.

              "        'Over the past decade, the Cincinnati-based musician Mol Sullivan has been charming audiences with songwriting that speaks earnestly and with grit. Sullivan’s performances, recorded or live, vibrate with sincerity, driven by emotional deliveries. Sullivan has spent the last few years sober and has used this time as a poignant backdrop for reflecting on an emotionally chequered past and reconciling being the forlorn villain of her own story. Dig into the expressive and poetically jubilant new single, “Eggshells” from Cincinnati-based Mol Sullivan. Sullivan is lyrically sharp with a quick-witted and buoyant melodic bounce, vocally swimming in a space of moving horn lines, and percussive jubilance. “Eggshells” is a well-crafted and warm transportation of indie glory. “Eggshells” is about a difficult relationship with a person who is unable to take accountability for their role in things, despite everyone around them trying to delicately hold up mirrors for them. We all know this person and have most likely been this person too, at times. I designed and built all the sets for the music video, self-directed, and starred in it. It’s a bizarre, storybook fantasy, traipsing through all of the dimensions of emotion when dealing with this person, all while having an overarching, sweet glaze of camp,” says Sullivan.'],\n",

              "        'Man Behind Bars After Alleged Late-Night Rice Assault Share Tweet  Rice should only be thrown at newlyweds, not strangers with whom you have beef. A South Carolina man is behind bars after his arrest last night for striking a woman with thrown cooked rice on a Myrtle Beach street. Police say Jaimes Encarnacion, 31, was collared Monday evening following the late-night incident. Seen at right, Encarnacion has been charged with misdemeanor assault & battery. According to a police report, Encarnacion threw rice into the vehicle of a 43-year-old male witness. While it is unclear who was the intended target, the rice struck a 39-year-old South Carolina woman sitting on the passenger side. Cops noted that Encarnacion was holding a takeout container of rice when they arrived on scene. Additionally, “rice was also observed inside the vehicle near where the victim and witness were sitting.” The incident occurred on a retail strip adjacent to an ocean beach as well as a Mexican eatery and a restaurant selling sushi. Police cited no injuries suffered in the rice attack.'],\n",

              "        'JULY 24--A Florida Man was busted for battering his wife over a TV show the woman was watching “that mentioned a homosexual comment that the defendant did not like,” police report. “I’m not having that in my house,” James Barr, 62, reportedly declared upon hearing the “homosexual comment,” according to an arrest report which does not identify the show his 62-year-old wife Linda was watching at the time of the incident earlier this month. Cops allege that Barr--who showed signs of intoxication--grabbed his wife’s arms and “forcefully” pushed her down into a recliner, where he “held her down in the chair not letting her get up.” The woman, police reported, attempted to kick Barr (seen at right) to free herself, but he “would not let go and let her get up.” While interviewing the woman, an officer noted that the woman “had a minor injury of broken skin on her left inner forearm” where she said she had been grabbed and pinned to the recliner. During police questioning, Barr reportedly copped to grabbing his wife in their residence in The Villages retirement community. Barr was arrested on a misdemeanor battery charge and booked into the Sumter County jail. He was freed from custody on July 7 after posting $500 bond. A registered Republican in the “Don’t say gay” free state of Florida, Barr has been married to the victim for nearly 40 years. The couple has three children and purchased their home in The Villages in April 2021 for $1.239 million. Barr’s spouse has subsequently asked that the criminal charge against her husband be dropped and says she will not participate in his prosecution. Linda Barr contends that the pair had been drinking and “the effect of alcohol impaired” James Barr’s judgement and “he was unaware of his action at the time.” Barr, who does not have a criminal record, has pleaded not guilty and is next due in court on August 29.

              "        'JULY 17--A burrito thrown by a woman at a Florida restaurant missed its intended target, instead hitting a male victim in the face, according to police who arrested the alleged food tosser. Investigators were called Wednesday evening to Rick’s Reef, a St. Pete Beach eatery, due to a “female subject yelling at customers.” The woman in question was Sarah Anne Kochera, 46, who lives with her boyfriend at his condo just down Gulf Boulevard from Rick’s. A witness told police that Kochera “was in a verbal dispute” with a man not identified in an arrest affidavit. At one point, Kochera “threw a burrito at this subject.” But the airborne burrito did not strike the man with whom Kochera quarreled. Instead, the Mexican delicacy “hit the victim in the face.” The affidavit does not indicate whether the victim was injured by the burrito. Kochera departed the restaurant before cops arrived. But she “remained nearby and was not cooperative with deputies.” Seen above, Kochera was charged with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and booked into the county jail. She bonded out of custody early Thursday morning after posting $250 bond. Kochera’s LinkedIn profile lists her as a “financial advisor” with a financial services company in the Tampa Bay area. Kochera was arrested last month for allegedly punching her 66-year-old boyfriend in the face during an argument in their residence. The victim, cops reported, had “a red mark over his right eye consistent with a closed fist punch.” Prosecutors subsequently declined to pursue a domestic battery case against Kochera, a decision that came two weeks after Kochera’s beau requested that the misdemeanor count be dropped and a judicial “no contact” order against Kochera order be eased.
